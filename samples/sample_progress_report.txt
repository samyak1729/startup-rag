METRICS & KPIs:

Productivity:
- Tasks completed this week: 12
- Tasks on track: 8/11 (73%)
- On-time delivery rate: 100% (12 of 12 completed by deadline)

Quality:
- Data validation errors: 0
- Safety incidents: 0
- Regulatory compliance issues: 0

Team Health:
- Team capacity: 95% utilized
- Overtime hours: 12 (minimal)
- Staff turnover: 0

BLOCKERS & CHALLENGES:

⚠ Moderate: FDA Meeting Scheduling
- Challenge: FDA scheduling system has 8-week waiting list
- Impact: Could delay pre-meeting by 1-2 weeks
- Mitigation: Regulatory consultants exploring expedited pathways
- Status: Working with FDA operations

⚠ Minor: Equipment Procurement
- Challenge: Long lead time (12 weeks) for next-gen sequencer
- Impact: May delay genomic analysis by 1 month
- Mitigation: Considering rental option as interim solution
- Status: Quotes being obtained

RESOURCE UTILIZATION:

Personnel: 12 FTE assigned (100% of allocation)
- Research scientists: 6 FTE
- Technicians: 4 FTE  
- Administrative: 2 FTE

Budget: $187K of $200K monthly allocation (93.5% consumed)
- Personnel: $142K
- Equipment/supplies: $35K
- Contractors: $10K

BUDGET STATUS:
January spending: On track
Q1 projection: May exceed by 5-8% (equipment acceleration)
Variance: Acceptable (within contingency)

NEXT WEEK PRIORITIES:

1. Complete FDA pre-meeting briefing package (James Wong)
2. Finalize animal study protocols and IACUC submissions (Dr. Rodriguez)
3. Execute 5 manufacturing pilot batches (Production team)
4. Begin regulatory documentation compilation (Sarah Chen)
5. Resolve FDA meeting scheduling (Regulatory team)

RISKS & MITIGATIONS:

Risk: Delay in animal study startup
Probability: Medium (20%)
Impact: 2-4 week delay to regulatory timeline
Mitigation: Pre-positioned all protocols and IACUC approvals

Risk: Manufacturing scale-up cost overrun
Probability: Low (10%)
Impact: $200K-$500K additional expense
Mitigation: Evaluated 3 CMO partners with fixed pricing

Risk: Key personnel departure
Probability: Low (5%)
Impact: 3-month delay to critical path activities
Mitigation: Retention bonuses in place, cross-training ongoing

DEPARTMENTAL NOTES:

The team continues to demonstrate strong execution. Morale is high with clear visibility into project milestones. The manufacturing team's process optimization should significantly improve unit economics. Recommend maintaining current pace and resource allocation through Q2.
