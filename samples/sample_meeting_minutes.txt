- James Wong (Project Manager)
- Lisa Park (Research Associate)
- Robert Zhang (Data Analyst)

Agenda:
1. Q1 objectives review
2. CRISPR targeting mechanism updates
3. Regulatory timeline discussion
4. Budget allocation for Q2
5. Next steps and action items

Minutes:

DISCUSSION - Q1 Objectives:
Dr. Chen presented the Q1 goals for the gene therapy initiative. We aim to complete Phase 2a safety studies by end of March. Current progress shows 85% completion on viral vector development. The team discussed challenges with off-target effects and proposed additional screening protocols.

DISCUSSION - CRISPR Targeting Mechanism:
Dr. Rodriguez shared updates on the targeting mechanism optimization. Recent experiments show improved specificity with modified sgRNA design. We achieved 94% on-target accuracy in vitro, exceeding our 90% target. However, in vivo validation is still pending. Next batch of animal studies begins next week.

DISCUSSION - Regulatory Timeline:
James Wong reviewed the regulatory pathway. IND application submission is planned for Q2 2024. FDA pre-meeting request submitted. Expected response in 6-8 weeks. We discussed the need for additional safety data to support our dosing rationale.

DISCUSSION - Q2 Budget:
Reviewed Q2 budget allocation. Proposed 15% increase for manufacturing scale-up. New equipment request for AAV production facility approved. Total Q2 budget: $2.3M (increase from $2.0M in Q1).

ACTION ITEMS:
1. Dr. Chen: Complete in vivo validation studies by Feb 28 - HIGH PRIORITY
2. Lisa Park: Prepare comprehensive safety report for FDA submission - DUE: Feb 15
3. Robert Zhang: Develop adverse event database and analysis protocol - DUE: Feb 1
4. Dr. Rodriguez: Coordinate with manufacturing for scale-up plans - ONGOING
5. James Wong: Schedule FDA pre-meeting call - DUE: Jan 22

DECISIONS MADE:
- Approved expansion of animal testing facility
- Approved new hire request for Quality Assurance role
- Approved purchase of next-gen sequencing equipment
- Decided to pursue both IV and intrathecal delivery routes

Next Meeting: Monday, January 22, 2024, 10:00 AM
Follow-up Items: All action items to be reviewed at next meeting.
