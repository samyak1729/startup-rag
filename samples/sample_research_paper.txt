ABSTRACT:
Neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease represent significant unmet medical needs with limited effective treatments. We developed a novel CRISPR-Cas9 delivery system targeting pathogenic mutations in the APP gene associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Our platform combines an engineered adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector with tissue-specific promoters to achieve selective neuronal transduction. In this preclinical study, we evaluated efficacy and safety in primary rat neurons and transgenic mouse models of neurodegeneration. Results demonstrate 94% on-target gene editing efficiency with minimal off-target modifications in neuronal cultures. In vivo studies show significant reduction in amyloid-beta accumulation (68% reduction, p<0.001) and restoration of cognitive function in treated animals compared to controls. Safety analysis reveals no evidence of hepatotoxicity, immune activation, or genotoxicity at therapeutic doses. This work establishes proof-of-concept for CRISPR-based treatment of neurodegenerative disease and supports progression to clinical development.

INTRODUCTION:
Neurodegenerative diseases represent a major global health burden, affecting approximately 50 million people worldwide. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form, accounting for 60-80% of dementia cases. Current disease-modifying treatments provide only modest symptomatic benefit, with no cure available. The amyloid-beta hypothesis suggests that accumulation of pathogenic amyloid-beta peptides triggers a cascade of events leading to neuronal dysfunction and death. The APP gene mutation E693Q (Iowa variant) causes early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (fAD), producing amyloid-beta with enhanced neurotoxic properties.

Genome editing technologies, particularly CRISPR-Cas9 systems, offer unprecedented opportunities to correct disease-causing mutations directly in patient neurons. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of CRISPR-based correction in cell cultures and animal models of other genetic disorders. However, delivery of CRISPR machinery to the brain remains technically challenging due to the blood-brain barrier and need for sustained expression in terminally differentiated neurons.

Our laboratory has engineered a novel approach combining:
1) Modified AAV6 serotype with enhanced neurotropism
2) Optimized CRISPR-Cas9 expression cassettes
3) Neuron-specific promoters (hSyn1) for selective targeting
4) Reduced off-target editing through improved sgRNA design

In this study, we present preclinical efficacy and safety data supporting progression toward human clinical trials.

METHODOLOGY:

Study Design:
This preclinical investigation consisted of three phases:
Phase 1: In vitro validation in primary neurons
Phase 2: In vivo efficacy studies in transgenic mouse models
Phase 3: Comprehensive safety and toxicology assessment

Primary Neuron Culture:
Cortical neurons were isolated from embryonic day 18 (E18) Sprague-Dawley rat brains. Neurons were plated at 50,000 cells/well in 96-well plates or 5 million cells/well in 6-well plates coated with poly-D-lysine. Cultures were maintained in Neurobasal-A medium supplemented with B27, glutamine, and antibiotics. At DIV7 (days in vitro), cells were transduced with AAV vectors at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10^5 viral genomes per cell. Cultures were analyzed at 48 hours, 7 days, and 14 days post-transduction.

Transgenic Mouse Model:
We utilized transgenic mice carrying the human APP Iowa mutation (APP E693Q) under control of the neuron-specific Thy1 promoter. These mice develop amyloid-beta pathology by 6 months of age with cognitive deficits measurable by Morris water maze by 10 months. Studies were conducted in 9-month-old female mice showing established pathology.

Treatment Groups:
- Control (saline, n=8)
- AAV-empty vector control (n=8)
- AAV-CRISPR targeting APP Iowa mutation (n=8)
- Active comparator (siRNA targeting APP, n=6)

Bilateral intracranial stereotactic injections were performed under isoflurane anesthesia at coordinates targeting the hippocampus (AP -2.0, ML ±1.5, DV -1.5). 2 microliters of virus suspension (4 × 10^11 viral genomes) were delivered at 0.2 microliters/minute using a 10 micrometer glass pipette. Animals were allowed 4 weeks for transgene expression before behavioral testing.

Behavioral Testing:
Morris Water Maze: Spatial memory was assessed using 4-day acquisition training followed by probe trials. Latency to platform, swim path length, and quadrant occupancy were measured.

Open Field Testing: General locomotor activity and anxiety-related behavior were assessed in a 50×50 cm arena with 10-minute recording periods.

Biochemical Analysis:
Total amyloid-beta and phosphorylated tau were quantified using sandwich ELISA on tissue homogenates. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 40-micrometer sections using antibodies against amyloid-beta (4G8), phosphorylated tau (AT8), and neuronal marker NeuN.

Off-Target Analysis:
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on neuronal samples 4 weeks post-transduction to identify potential off-target CRISPR editing events. Libraries were prepared using Illumina TruSeq chemistry and sequenced to 30× coverage. Bioinformatic analysis employed MiSeq Reporter software with custom scripts to identify potential off-target sites predicted by Cas-OFFinder algorithm.

RESULTS:

In Vitro Efficacy:
Primary rat cortical neurons showed efficient AAV transduction with >85% of neurons expressing GFP at 48 hours post-transduction. CRISPR-mediated APP gene editing was confirmed by T7 endonuclease assay, revealing 94% editing efficiency at the target locus (Figure 1A). Edited APP transcripts were reduced by 87% as measured by qRT-PCR (Figure 1B).

Amyloid-beta levels in culture media decreased by 76% in CRISPR-treated wells compared to controls (p<0.001), with reductions apparent within 7 days of transduction and sustained through 14 days (Figure 1C).

In Vivo Efficacy:
Morris Water Maze testing revealed significant cognitive improvements in CRISPR-treated animals compared to saline controls. Latency to platform was reduced from 35.2±4.1 seconds in controls to 18.7±3.2 seconds in treated animals during probe trials (p=0.002). CRISPR-treated mice spent 38% of time in the target quadrant versus 22% in controls (p<0.05).

Brain tissue analysis showed profound reduction in amyloid-beta levels in CRISPR-treated animals. Immunostaining revealed 68% reduction in amyloid-beta plaque burden in the hippocampus (p<0.001) and 52% reduction in cortex (p=0.003) compared to controls. Phosphorylated tau levels were reduced by 45% (p=0.01).

These improvements were comparable to or exceeded the siRNA control group, with CRISPR treatment showing more sustained effects beyond 12 weeks.

Safety Analysis:
Comprehensive toxicology assessment revealed no adverse effects of AAV-CRISPR treatment:
- No hepatotoxicity (normal liver function tests, no histological changes)
- No immune activation (IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels comparable to controls)
- No genotoxicity (no increases in DNA damage markers or apoptosis rates)
- No weight loss or behavioral abnormalities
- Normal hematology and clinical chemistry panels

Off-Target Analysis:
Whole genome sequencing identified zero off-target CRISPR editing events in neuronal tissue samples. Potential off-target sites predicted in silico were not detected at coverage thresholds of >10 reads.

DISCUSSION:
This work demonstrates successful in vivo CRISPR-based correction of pathogenic APP mutations with significant therapeutic benefit and acceptable safety profile. Key achievements include:

1. High Editing Efficiency: 94% on-target editing in vitro and sustained in vivo
2. Remarkable Safety Profile: No evidence of genotoxicity or immune activation
3. Sustained Cognitive Improvement: Benefits maintained through 16-week follow-up
4. Mechanism Validation: Reduction in amyloid-beta correlates with behavioral improvements

The AAV6-based delivery system enables efficient neuronal transduction while the tissue-specific promoter minimizes off-target expression. Optimized sgRNA design achieves minimal off-target cutting, with zero detectable off-target events by WGS.

Limitations of this study include use of transgenic mouse models versus human patient tissue, and relatively short follow-up period (16 weeks). Longer-term studies will be needed to assess durability and identify potential delayed adverse events.

These results support progression to regulatory preclinical studies and IND-enabling toxicology studies to advance toward human clinical trials.

CONCLUSION:
We have successfully developed and validated a CRISPR-based gene therapy for neurodegenerative disease with excellent preclinical efficacy and safety. This platform technology may be applicable to other APP mutations and neurodegenerative conditions. Continued development toward clinical application is warranted.
